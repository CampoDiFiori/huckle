### Credits 

- The Unikernel I used for this project has been built in its entirety excluding the Interrupt Handling by following this well written blog  [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/), by Phillip Oppermann. 

- The following blogs helped me in organizing my project and also helped by pointing me in the right direction when I was stuck in a quagmire of triple faults. 
  - https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/
  - https://github.com/ryanra/RustOS (Helped me a lot in organizing my code and understanding how PCI devices work)

Will add instructions as to how to download and run this server on a virtual-box. 

Long live Open Source!
